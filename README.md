Vingester
=========

**Ingest Web Contents as Video Streams**

**Vingester** is a small Electron-based desktop application for
use under Windows, macOS and Linux to run multiple Chromium-based
Web browser instances and ingesting their rendered Web Contents as
desktop/window-captured or NDI-multicasted video streams for further use
in video mixing applications.

**Vingester** is primarily intended as an essential companion
application to OBS Studio and OBS.Ninja in order to ingest the video
streams of OBS.Ninja meeting particpants into an OBS Studio based
production in an efficient and robust way. As challenge here is that
although OBS.Ninja could be directly running in a Browser Source of OBS
Studio, using it for more than 3-4 participants causes a dramatical
performance drop-down in OBS Studio and as a result at least regularily
destroys the audio quality in OBS Studio.
