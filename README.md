=========

**Ingest Web Contents as Video Streams**

This is **Vingester**, a small Electron-based desktop application
for running multiple Chromium-based Web browser instances and
ingesting their rendered Web Contents as desktop/window-captured
or NDI-multicasted video streams for further use in video mixing
applications. It is primarily intended as a companion application to OBS
Studio in order to ingest OBS.Ninja sessions in an efficient way.
